					<h1>Welcome</h1>

					<p>Ogwen Valley is the most northerly of the main valleys in the Snowdonia National Park, North Wales, UK.
					The mountains that surround the valley are about 1000 metres high and the terrain varies quite considerably.
					With eleven of the Welsh 3000-feet peaks and cliffs that reach about 300-400 metres in height, our area is very popular
					with both walkers and climbers.</p>

					<img class="center" src="images/bryn_poeth_vehicles.jpg" />

					<p>The Carneddau mountains to the north of our base at Bryn Poeth (Oggie Base) are high and open, but there is also open moorland with heather, bracken and sheep, as well as areas of dense forest and fast rivers around Capel Curig. This mixture of terrain calls for the team members to be competent in high angle rescue work as well as open terrain search and swift water techniques. </p>

					<p>As a rescue team we now have over 100 callouts per year. There are approximately 50 people on the team, all volunteers, many of whom are qualified to a high standard of First Aid. <img class="right" src="images/cneifion_arete.jpg" /> We also have a number of Search Managers and Swift Water Rescue technicians. Although we are completely independent of the Police we work at their request; Team Members are then contacted by telephone or SMS. Our usual response time to an incident is typically 20 minutes before deploying someone on to the hill and a full team callout can be effected within 30 minutes. <a href="http://www.raf.mod.uk/rafvalley/">RAF Valley</a> has a flight of Sea King SAR helicopters 20 minutes' flying time away and we often work together in rescuing and searching for people. </p>

					<h1>History</h1>
					
					<h2>Beginnings</h2>
					<p>People have been scrambling over the hills for pleasure for centuries. The first recorded ascent of Snowdon was in 1639.
					In 1778 Thomas Pennant was bagging summits. In 1854 George Borrow was exploring "Wild Wales". However, it was during the Victorian
					era that a greater interest was taken in the mountains. Many mountaineering clubs were formed with regular "meets" at key locations
					such as huts, guesthouses and hotels. The Gorphwysfa Hotel (now Pen y Pass Youth Hostel), the Pen y Gwryd Hotel and Ogwen Cottage
					are but a few examples.</p>

					<img class="center" src="images/rescue.jpg" />

					<h2>Self-Help Rescue</h2>
					<p>Traditionally, before the formation of Mountain Rescue Teams, those who ventured into the hills and mountains had to be able to 
					look after themselves out of necessity. The spirit of these people extended to helping other in distress in the same environment. 
					If a climber had an accident other members of their party would either evacaute the casualty or make it to the local hotel or pub
					and gather together a group of climbers who would help rescue the unfortunate, even though they would have no specialist kit or 
					training. The earliest record of an organised search and recovery is in 1832 when a man was missing on Moel Siabod.</p>

					<h2>The Need for Change</h2>
					<p>After the Scafell Disaster of 1903 in which four climbers died, the Climbers Club decided that basic rescue equipment should be
					held at some of these key locations. By 1905 stretchers were added to the caches. Between the World Wars, the mountaineering clubs
					set up a "Stretcher Committee". One of their members was an engineer called Eustace Thomas. He and his company developed the first
					purpose made mountain rescue stretcher - The Thomas Stretcher. The lack of analgesics was of great concern. In 1934 Dr Wilson Hey
					of the Rucsack Club applied for a license to stock morphine at these Rescue Posts. He was refused so he continued to flout the law.
					He was finally taken to Court in 1949 where he made an issue of the case. Shortly afterwards, the law was changed to grant a license
					to the newly formed Mountain Rescue Committee. Limited stocks of morphine could now be stocked at these Mountain Rescue Posts with
					additional stocks at the more busy Posts such as Ogwen Cottage.</p>

					<h2>Rescue in Snowdonia</h2>
					<p>Chris Briggs moved into the Pen y Gwryd Hotel in 1947 and soon became the focal character for Mountain Rescue. The Kings Hotel
					in Capel Curig was converted into a centre for excellence for outdoor pursuits in 1954. Here, the trained staff of Plas y Brenin
					as well as their students would assist in rescues. In 1959, Ron James, Trevor Jones and Tony Mason-Hornby bought Ogwen Cottage 
					from Mrs.Williams. They started a dedicated mountain training school. Mrs Williams' parting words of advice on rescue were "Fire
					a red flare from the car park - get the climbers together and put the one with the cleanest boots in charge". Soon the instructors
					found themselves on regular rescues and along with a few friends, The Ogwen Cottage Mountain Rescue Team was formed.</p>

					<h2>OVMRO is Born</h2>
					<p>Early in 1964 Ogwen Cottage was sold to Birmingham Education Authority. Ron James remained as Chief Instructor for another five
					years. Now the staff had the pleasure of school holidays. It was during the Summer holidays of 1964 when one of the instructors,
					John Glews, fell off a new route on Clogwyn Du. During his rescue by a hastily formed party, he soon realized that there was a need
					for a dedicated Mountain Rescue Team. Thus OVMRO was conceived in the Autumn of that year. It was made up of the Ogwen Cottage Staff,
					Mountaineering Club of North Wales, Bangor University Mountaineering Club and a few other regulars. The Inaugural Meeting was held
					in March 1965.</p>

					<h2>Ogwen Cottage</h2>
					<p>During 1966 the team was based in a caravan behind Ogwen Cottage. Both OVMRO and Ogwen Cottage Outdoor Pursuits Centre began to
					grow. Gradually, the staff were no longer the mainstay of the Rescue Team and Birmingham Education Authority needed more space.
					The two organisations separated in 1975 with OVMRO leaving its home in the Ogwen Cottage generator shed to a temporary store in
					Idwal Cottage. Meanwhile, representations were being made <img class="right" src="images/teammembers.jpg" /> to the National Trust to lease part of the old water bailiff's cottage
					at Bryn Poeth. The cottage had been used as a one man mountaineering school run by Dudley Stevens in the 1960's and now the National
					Trust were using it for their footpath building volunteers.</p>

					<h2>Bryn Poeth</h2>
					<p>During 1976, OVMRO moved into one small front room and a lean-to shed for the equipment store. After ten years of cramped
					conditions in a building, which was deteriorating, the Committee proposed to the National Trust that OVMRO would extend and refurbish
					the building. After a couple of years fund raising, the Team moved into a Police Bedford RL signals wagon parked adjacent to Bryn
					Poeth and the builders moved on site just after Easter of 1988. The Team moved back at Christmas. The new Bryn Poeth was twice the
					size and could now boast flush toilets, hot showers, two bunk rooms, a fully equipped kitchen and central heating. The building was
					set out so that it could be shared with the National Trust volunteers who stay for working holidays.</p>

					<h2>Transport</h2>
					<p>By 1994, after a rescue when members shared the back of a farmer's Land Rover with his sheep, it was realised that there was a 
					need for a Team vehicle. Fund raising was organised and in February 1995 the 110 Land Rover was delivered. Having a vehicle meant
					we needed a garage at Bryn Poeth, so fund raising started again and in the Autumn of 1996 work started. Whilst building the garage,
					the first floor of Bryn Poeth was converted into a training/lecture room. This was all completed in April 1997.</p>

					<h2>Casualty Care</h2>
					<p>OVMRO has continually tried to improve mountain rescue with innovation, new equipment and training. Dr. Iuean Jones, the Casualty
					Officer at the C&A Hospital in Bangor and Team member set up First Aid Training specifically for mountain rescue in the late 1960's.
					His course was soon recognised by civilian and RAF mountain rescue teams throughout the UK. In 1967 a RAF helicopter was used for
					mountain rescue for the first time. In the late 1980's Members of the team designed and built The Ogwen Stretcher. They also devised
					the "autolocks", a system of controlling the lowering of the stretcher by the jockeys on the cliff face. In 1994 a scheme was set up
					to appoint Team Leaders on merit measured against specific abilities and qualities. This avoided the popular vote. In 1998 the Team
					held an external audit carried out by members of other MRT's. This "no holds barred" meant that we could get a true measure of the
					Organisation as seen by other MRT's.</p>

					<h2>Memorable Incidents</h2>
					<p>Throughout the history of the Organisation, there have been some memorable incidents. The Team has been involved in some large
					mountain searches, which have resulted in national publicity. Sometimes these multi-day searches have resulted in the recovery of 
					a body but in 1973, four Duke of Edinburgh boys were found after four days of searching by 500 people. In 1988 members of the Team
					assisted the Police in a very large search for a little girl who had been abducted on the Welsh Borders. Later that year the Team
					was called to rescue three canoeists from the raging torrents of the Conwy Falls. This was captured on film and broadcast to the 
					nation. A decade later this rescue was re-enacted for the BBC 999 programme. 1988 closed with members assisting at the Lockerbie 
					disaster. In 1996 OVMRO was assisted by neighboring MRT's in a four casualty Winter rescue. This required over fifty people to carry
					the stretchers down the icy slopes of the Carneddau Mountains.</p>

					<h2>Film and TV</h2>
					<p>OVMRO has been involved with films and TV since soon after its conception. Recently, it appeared in a full-length fly on the 
					wall documentary for the BBC and in Songs of Praise. It has also appeared in Hearts of Gold and Dr. Tony Jones was the star of
					"This is your Life".</p>

					<h2>Royal Connections</h2>
					<p>The Organisation has attracted the attentions of Prince Charles who visited the original Bryn Poeth in 1976 and the Secretary
					of State for Wales, William Hague in 1997.</p>

					<h2>Sponsorship</h2>
					<p>In 1999 the Team became involved in a very successful promotion of Welsh Mountain Lamb through Bennetts and Safeways. This
					promotion resulted in the new purpose built 130 Land Rover being presented to OVMRO in February 2001.</p>

					<h2>The Team Today</h2>
					<p>OVMRO continues to be one of the busiest Mountain Rescue Teams in the country assisting the Police and Ambulance authorities
					with rough terrain search and rescue in Northern Snowdonia. Its members are on stand-by <strong>24 hours a day, 365 days of the
					year</strong>; giving their time for free to assist fellow users of the great outdoors who have come to grief.</p>

					<h2>Treble Three</h2>
					<p>Treble Three, or more simply 333, was set up in 1997. The purpose of the group is to help raise both the profile and funds
					for the Ogwen Valley Mountain Rescue Organisation. The enigmatic numbers were chosen as they are the last three digits of our
					telephone number and quite frankly they are reminiscent of 999.</p>
					
					<p>333 Pics By becoming a member of Treble Three you will be supporting the Ogwen Valley Mountain Rescue Organisation in providing
					a rescue service, even if you don't have the time, skills, experience or fitness required to be active on the mountains.</p>
					
					<p>As a member you will receive a membership card entitling you to discount in some equipment shops, a cloth badge and a car sticker.
					We aim to have a social event per month in the form of camping weekends, accompanied walks and bike rides, and the door at Oggie Base
					is always open for that just off the hill brew.</p>
					
					<p>It costs on average £60,000 to keep the team fully operational. Great expense goes on equipment and training as well as running a
					rescue base and two Land Rover ambulances. </p>

					<h2>Oggie 8 - Sat 2nd August</h2>
					<p>This is our 7th year of running this event, which is becoming a national institution!</p>

					<img class="center" src="images/oggie8start.jpg" />

					<p>It attracts teams from all across the country who wish to pit their strength, stamina and endurance against the Ogwen Valley 3000ft Peaks!! It's about like-minded people, having a great day of walking and to top it off there is the legendary after party with plenty of hearty food and drink!</p>

					<p><strong>This is our main source of fundraising.</strong> We are dependent upon every £ that you raise in sponsorship for us. OVMRO is funded by charitable donations, requiring us to raise £60k per year in order to provide this free service to the thousands of visitors to the area.</p>

					<p>So far the 2013 event has raised <strong>£8,450.00</strong>, so a huge thank you to all who took part and sponsored the event. The winning team was TO THE PUB, who completed the new longer route in 7hrs 48 mins.</p>

					<p><strong>OUR TARGET FOR 2014 IS TO BEAT THIS AMOUNT AND RAISE OVER £10,000.</strong></p>

					<p><strong>IT WOULD BE FANTASTIC IF YOU COULD HELP US ACHIEVE THIS</strong></p>

					<p>This works out at an average of £100 per participant. We don't set a minimum sponsorship amount as many events of this nature do, so we really do rely on you to do what you can... If we had 100 people each raising £100, we would be well on our way to achieving our target. And if you are unable to commit a team, we would very much appreciate a donation!</p>

					<p>Just think what this money will mean to the people that we rescue... it would be a huge step towards the next landrover... or would pay for us to modernise our radios... or cover the cost of refurbishing base... or essential equipment to aid our rescues...</p>

					<p>So we hope that you will do us proud yet again and help us achieve this target and <strong>help us to help others</strong>.</p>

					<p>To make it easier, you can now do everything you need online! ... Applications, entrance donation and sponsorship. For those that prefer, the traditional post and sponsorship form option is also available.</p>

					<h3>Oggie 8 2013 is now complete</h3>

					<img class="center" src="images/winners13.jpg" />

					<p>Congratulations to "To The Pub" who took first place by completing the new longer course in a time of 7 hours 48 minutes. Thank you to everyone who competed. The weather was perfect; the marshalls, organisers and administrators brilliant as always; and the after party with a hired fish and chip van was a stroke of genius.</p>

					<p>There is a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/49479868@N03/with/9437311842/">Flickr page</a> containing pictures of the event.</p>
